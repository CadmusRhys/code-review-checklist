code-review-checklist
=====================

This document aims to be a flexible, relevant guide to code peer review.

Users will probably want to fork the this repo and modify the check list to suit their needs, desires, proclivities. I plan to keep a very general form of the check list at the head of the master branch to act as a template for more specific code review guides.

I welcome contributions to the check list, so long as the principles are general best practices, rather than guidelines for a specific situation.
